## Goal

  The goal is to make a very simple, working application that will allow me to make my own list of things to do. It should display list item below and allow me to delete the item when finished.

### Extra Credit

  Extra Credit would be to actually turn this into a downloadable application using [RunKit endpoint](https://runkit.com/docs/endpoint).

#### List of things to accomplish

  *- Get to a point in the program where I decide to create a new branch.
  *- _*That branch will be utilizing a completely different framework.*_
  *- Framework to start out with is Bootstrap
  *-
